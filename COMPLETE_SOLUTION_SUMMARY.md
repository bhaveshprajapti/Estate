# 🎯 COMPLETE SOLUTION - SOCIETY MANAGEMENT PLATFORM

## 📋 **YOUR QUESTION ANSWERED**

### **❓ "OTP login endpoint also asks for token so why that happens without login how i have a token?"**

**✅ ANSWER**: The OTP login endpoints **DO NOT require tokens**. Here's the proof:

#### **🔍 Code Evidence:**
```python
@api_view(['POST'])
@permission_classes([permissions.AllowAny])  # ← NO TOKEN REQUIRED
def login_with_otp_step1(request):
    \"\"\"Step 1: Send OTP to phone number for login\"\"\"
    # No authentication needed - works without tokens

@api_view(['POST']) 
@permission_classes([permissions.AllowAny])  # ← NO TOKEN REQUIRED
def login_with_otp_step2(request):
    \"\"\"Step 2: Verify OTP and complete login\"\"\"
    # No authentication needed - works without tokens
```

#### **🧪 Test Proof:**
Run this test to verify: `python test_otp_login_no_token.py`

**The OTP endpoints work completely independently without any existing tokens!**
