## 🔐 Security Rationale

Certain functions are restricted for security reasons:

1. **Staff Creation**: Only SUB_ADMIN can create staff to prevent unauthorized access
2. **Visitor Passes**: Managed by SUB_ADMIN to maintain security control
3. **Gate Updates**: Handled by authorized staff to ensure proper security protocols

## 🔄 Request Process for Restricted Functions

Members can request restricted services through:

1. **Helpdesk System**: Submit service requests
2. **Complaint System**: Report issues requiring administrative action
3. **Direct Communication**: Contact SUB_ADMIN or staff through directory

## 🎯 Summary

Members have **comprehensive access** to all essential society services:
- ✅ Personal management (profile, vehicles)
- ✅ Community participation (amenities, marketplace)
- ✅ Service access (complaints, requests)
- ✅ Information access (bills, directory, notices)

For security-sensitive operations, members can **request services** which are then processed by authorized personnel (SUB_ADMIN or STAFF).

This design ensures members have full participation in society activities while maintaining appropriate security controls for sensitive operations.
